# data/

This folder contains all data files necessary to reproduce the statistics and figures in "Talking to talkers." All data has been de-identified for public sharing.

## Files
- all_basiclevel_ransubj.csv: This file contains all annotated nouns in the corpus. Each row represents one annotated noun.
- cdi_ransubj.csv: This file contains MCDI scores for each participant, each month.
- lena_counts_ransubj.csv: This file contains aggregated counts of adult words, conversational turns, and child vocalizations generated from daylong audio recordings by LENA's algorithm for each participant, each month.
- talk_onset_ransubj.csv: This file contains the age at which each child was observed and reported to first say a word (i.e., talk onset). This data was originally generated for the manuscript "Point, Walk, Talk" (see https://github.com/CharlotteMoore927/PointWalkTalkPublic).
- top3hours_ransubj.csv: This file contains onset and offset times for "top" hours within the daylong audio (i.e., hourlong regions where the most talk occurred, as calculated with LENA metrics). See text for more details.
